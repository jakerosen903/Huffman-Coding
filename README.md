# Huffman-Coding
Digital data compression has become paramount in this modern technological era. This project covers Huffman Coding - an important method of achieving lossless data compression. The project decompresses an already compressed file, and using Huffman coding, writes algorithms that can compress any file i.e. sound, image, text, etc.
